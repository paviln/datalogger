# datalogger

This is a half-way semester project project focused around the ideas of IoT. 

The project is to make a datalogging system for a fictive company named "JÃ¼nger-Agro"

To store data about plants. 

The datalogging system consists of 3 parts. 2 clients and 1 server. 
The 2 clients are the sensor system itself and an application for phone for the user to control and see the data of the plants. 
The server is an API.

The sensor system is built, controlled by Raspberry Pi and coded in Python3, the phone application is coded in Xamarin (C#) and the API in pure typescript.
